May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.
To change a habit, make a conscious decision, then act out the new behavior.
Every day brings new choices.
There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them.
If you chase two rabbits, both will escape.
One day or day one. You decide.
You can either experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The choice is yours.
Attitude is everything, so pick a good one.
There are only two options regarding commitment; you’re either in or you’re out. There’s no such thing as life in-between.
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both.
The man of decision cannot be stopped! The man of indecision cannot be started! Take your own choice.
Choose to be optimistic. It feels better.
You and only you are responsible for your life choices and decisions.
In any given moment we have two options: to step forward into growth or step back into safety.
We make our choices, then our choices make us.
