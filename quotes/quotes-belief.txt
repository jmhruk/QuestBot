Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail.
Almost every successful person begins with two beliefs: the future can be better than the present, and I have the power to make it so.
As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live.
It’s not who you think you are that holds you back; it’s who you think you’re not.
Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground.
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future.
First thing every morning before you arise, say out loud, ‘I believe’, three times.
If I could give one tip for people – it’s not an exercise or nutrition regimen. It’s to walk your talk and believe in yourself, because at the end of the day, the dumbbell and diet don’t get you in shape. It’s your accountability to your word.
Trust because you are willing to accept the risk, not because it’s safe or certain.
Northing is impossible; the word itself says ‘I’m possible’!
Hope fills the holes of my frustration in my heart.
Believe while others are doubting.
Magic is believing in yourself. If you can make that happen, you can make anything happen.
Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.
As you learn to trust yourself something miraculous happens. You begin to trust the process you are living and the miracles life brings!
