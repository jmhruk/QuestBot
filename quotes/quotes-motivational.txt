No matter who you are, no matter what you do, you absolutely, positively do have the power to change.
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.”
Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly
You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.
No matter how slow you go you’re still lapping everyone on the couch.
You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
Motivation is when your dreams put on work clothes.
If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way. If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.
If you’re tired of starting over, stop giving up.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
Where you start is not as important as where you finish.
Motivation is like food for the brain. You cannot get enough in one sitting. It needs continual and regular top ups.
Every moment is a fresh beginning.
Within you right now is the power to do things you never dreamed possible. This power becomes available to you just as soon as you can change your beliefs.
